# Disney-API-Alkemy

<h1> BACKEND - Java </h1>
<h2>Spring Boot (API) ðŸš€</h2>
<h3>Goal</h3>
<p> Develop an API to explore the world of Disney, which will allow knowing and modifying the
     characters that compose it and understand in which films they participated. On the other hand, it must
     expose the information so that any frontend can consume it.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        ðŸ‘‰ Use Spring Boot.
    </li>
    <li>
        ðŸ‘‰ No need of Frontend.
    </li>
    <li>
        ðŸ‘‰ Paths must follow a REST pattern.
    </li>
    <li>
        ðŸ‘‰ Use Spring Security library.
    </li>
</ul>
